		2. Identify regions that show a large variability in connectivity across tasks
			1. Are these similar or the same?
			2. 
		3. Select studies by thresholding based on different cognitve topics and test global connectivity of regions aross different types of studies
			1. Which regions vary the most?
			2. Which regions have the highest global connectivity across these tasks?
				1. Do insula and dlPFC markedly differ?
				2. 
		4. Test these hypotheses across another set of more detailed meta-analycic data that has functional connectivity such as the human connectome project

3. Resting state network dynamics generalize to task based dynamics
	- Resting state truly reflects distance in function (open question)
	- Do any regions have more similar resting state patterns than predicted by function?
	- Do function and coactivation make divergent predictions
	- Do these patterns change based on the topic of the study?
		- Are there regions that change their connectivity more (or have higher connectivity across all?)
