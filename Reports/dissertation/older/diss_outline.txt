Region-based functional anatomical atlas
	- Point of this is not the find the regions but simply to see what predict their activity using multivariate techniques

Clustering techniques
	- Cluster whole brain using feature or coactivation space
	- See differences
	- “Functional units”

Flexibility / stability of regions
	- Based on coacviation patterns
	- Based on functional labels
	- Across differ types of functions - how variable

Pairwise distance/comparison
	- How different are two pairs of regions and what function differentiate them
	- Good for focused analysis of a certain set of regions

Relationship to resting state 
	- Resting state truly reflects distance in function (open question)
	- Do any regions have more similar resting state patterns than predicted by function?
	- Do function and coactivation make divergent predictions
	- Do these patterns change based on the topic of the study?
		- Are there regions that change their connectivity more (or have higher connectivity across all?)
	
Vectors of function
	- Could be used to further charachterize regions that do not behave like spatially homogenous functional units
	- Maybe can identify those that are less spatially homogenous vs line break


Theoretical Questions:
1. Organization of vmPFC (reread Wager et al.,)
	1. What are the functional units in vmPFC?
		1. Use both coactivation and functional 
			1. Compare analytically overlap and quality of parcellations
		2. Try to settle on an ideal number of clusters with the caveat that this is not a great metric and is greatly affected by data quality
		3. Compare to resting state solutions 
	2. What is the function of the units of vmPFC?
		1. Use mv analysis to describe function of units
	3. How different in function are the different units? And what words differentiate them
	4. What do they have in common?
	5.. How diverse are the different units in function?
	6. Perhaps compare to subcortical systems or see which different regions highly coactivate 
	
	TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS: vmPFC has high diversity of function
	
	
2. Insula/ACC vs dlPFC
	1. Introduction - both DLPFC and opercular network have been charachterized and being ‘control networks’
		1. DLPFC is supposed to be more transiet while operculum is thought to be more sustained
			1. However, meta-analytically, they can sometimes be confused as are both active across a diverse amount of tasks (both have high diversity)
		2. DLPFC is also thought to more flexibly switch connectivity to surservent processes
			1. However, evidence that has been used is not sufficiently diverse - even though the tasks in Cole are supposed to be indendent, they all require flexibly configuring response mappings which is what DLPFC specializes in. 
				1. Thus their finding may be biased by the task
				2. Is dlPFC truly more flexibly in its dynamic across a wide specturum of tasks?
					1. Can we distinguish it from insula which should presumably be active but have low coactivation variability?
					2. Meta-analytic coactivation may be useful as it closely mirror results from functional conectivity but encompasses a large number of tasks
					3. 
	2. Steps:
		1. Identify regions that across all entire meta-analytic database show great diversity of functions involved
		2. Identify regions that show a large variability in connectivity across tasks
			1. Are these similar or the same?
			2. 
		3. Select studies by thresholding based on different cognitve topics and test global connectivity of regions aross different types of studies
			1. Which regions vary the most?
			2. Which regions have the highest global connectivity across these tasks?
				1. Do insula and dlPFC markedly differ?
				2. 
		4. Test these hypotheses across another set of more detailed meta-analycic data that has functional connectivity such as the human connectome project

3. Resting state network dynamics generalize to task based dynamics
	- Resting state truly reflects distance in function (open question)
	- Do any regions have more similar resting state patterns than predicted by function?
	- Do function and coactivation make divergent predictions
	- Do these patterns change based on the topic of the study?
		- Are there regions that change their connectivity more (or have higher connectivity across all?)

	Anomaly detection for specific topics across regions
