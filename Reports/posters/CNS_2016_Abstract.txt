The human lateral frontal cortex (LFC) has been the subject of intense study, having been associated with diverse psychological processes that include motor function, language, working memory and goal-directed cognition. There is a need for comprehensive efforts to identify functional subregions with distinct functional profiles across these diverse processes. To address this need, we systematically created a functional-anatomical mapping of LFC using Neurosynth-- a database of over 11,000 neuroimaging studies. We used k-means clustering to identify 23 putatively separable regions of LFC on the basis of meta-analytic co-activation and reconstruced the functional networks each region co-activated with. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological concepts most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a wide variety of functional diversity across frontal cortex. However, functional differences between spatially nearby regions were often relatively subtle (e.g. posterior vs. mid DLPFC). Thus, we employed a pairwise multivariate classification analysis to specific determine which psychological concepts reliably differentiated activity between pairs of regions. This focused discriminate analysis revealed subtle, but reliable functional differences betwen LFC sub-regions that had previously been confounded using large-scale meta-analysis.
